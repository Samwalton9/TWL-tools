  This data is collected by analysing data from two spreadsheets: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ndJiMkWvsKpEXZpE5m6bFFgJHulD3M9gDpIIfe-LsKU/edit">A-Z Sources Search</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BCldgV2ny6YOlubciOB2dzhGlKJiWgNQVa3FLTG0180/edit">Authentication progress tracking</a>. When adding new partners to those sheets please ensure that their partner name is the same in both. EBSCO is an exception (the script fixes that one internally).
  <br>
  <br>
  The data only counts partners with "Yes" in their Proxy or Bundle columns. Answers such as 'Maybe' or 'Likely' are not counted.
  <br>
  <br>
  After pressing Calculate, your browser window will show that it is loading. The process can take a few minutes to complete.
